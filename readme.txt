This is a blank WordPress theme originally forked from Chris Coyier. Though it's so different now, all I'm forking is mostly the idea.

GobbleBlank is mostly for those annoying 5 page marketing sites you're building that includes blogs. It is meant to, for the most part, speed up your development of common items that are in these sites.

More to come later.

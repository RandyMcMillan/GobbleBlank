# GobbleBlank Theme for WordPress

This blank theme was originally based on [Chris Coyier's Blank Theme](http://digwp.com/2010/02/blank-wordpress-theme/).

I thought it was a great idea to publish a blank theme for everyone to use for free. This is what I use, generally, as a starting point for most marketing/corporate sites I am building. It's purpose is to speed up development.

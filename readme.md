# GobbleBlank Theme for WordPress

This blank theme was originally based on [Chris Coyier's Blank Theme](http://digwp.com/2010/02/blank-wordpress-theme/). At this point you probably can't recognize it, but the concept remains the same.

This theme is primarily for corporate and marketing sites. Do you make a lot of "websites"? This theme is for you all out there making 5-10 page websites.

## Usage

The usage for this theme can go two routes:

1. Fork it, change the top comments in style.css and have at it.
2. Create a child theme and preserve the original theme functionality and markup.

The original intention for this theme is to go with route #1. My fear is that eventually when this theme gets approved and uploaded to the theme repository, and I push an update; a beginning user who is just starting out to edit it, blindly presses update and their styles are lost.

However, if the theme actually fits most of your needs, and you are making just edits to style.css and a few other pages, feel free to create a child theme so you can continue to receive updates from the WP repository. Just note that the intention of the theme, is for you to download a new one, every time you start a new project (at least that is my use with this theme).

## Features

1. Adds a class to first and last child of the dynamic WordPress menu function 
2. Custom elements are not stripped out in the wysiwyg the client uses (e.g. iframe for videos)
3. 2 Sidebars
4. 2 Menus
5. Editor Styles
6. Feed Links
7. Standard WP Styles ready to be defined in style.css
8. Custom Background Enabled
9. Removed WP version along with other not really needed links in the head
10. Basic print styles added (removes navigation menus, appends link paths)

## Future

1. HTML5?
   This whole HTML5 thing is such a buzz word. I have not included it now, just because for a lot of my B2B clients, they are using IE and are just not ready for it. So I haven't bothered...yet. Doesn't mean I'm not thinking about it.
2. Responsiveness?
   The intention of theme is for people to define their own breaking points. Build on top of this. The theme is just a skeleton, so this is where you step in and add your own grids or whatever else you want to. The last thing I wanted to do was add a bunch of frameworks that people do not use or are not familiar with, and are wasting productive time stripping things out.
3. More functions? This is where you let me know what I'm missing out on.

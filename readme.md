# GobbleBlank Theme for WordPress

This blank theme was originally based on [Chris Coyier's Blank Theme](http://digwp.com/2010/02/blank-wordpress-theme/).

This theme is primarily for corporate and marketing sites. Do you make a lot of "websites"? This theme is for you all out there making 5-10 page websites.

## Features

1. Adds a class to first and last child of the dynamic WordPress menu function 
2. Custom elements are not stripped out in the wysiwyg the client uses (e.g. iframe for videos)
3. Uses custom stylesheet for the wysiwyg
4. Allows for custom client background
5. Comes standard with footer and main menus

More to come later.
